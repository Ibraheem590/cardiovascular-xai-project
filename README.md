# Cardiovascular XAI Project

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-tier explainable AI framework
for cardiovascular disease prediction using XGBoost and model-agnostic XAI techniques.

## Overview
The project combines:
- XGBoost for cardiovascular disease prediction
- SHAP, LIME, and Anchors for explainability
- LLM-based narratives for clinician and patient reporting

## Datasets
- Cardiovascular Disease dataset (Kaggle)
- Heart Disease dataset (Cleveland, Hungary)

## Structure
- `*.ipynb` — training, evaluation, and explainability notebooks
- Datasets used for model training and testing

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- LIME
- python-dotenv

## Notes
API keys are loaded locally using a `.env` file and are not included in this repository.
